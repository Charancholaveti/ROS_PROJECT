# Two-Wheeled Robot with Jointed Arm

## Project Overview

We started this project with a two-wheeled robot design, incorporating one caster wheel for stability. The robot is equipped with a two-jointed arm to enable basic manipulation tasks. Our goal is to create a functional robot capable of autonomous movement and object interaction. The project serves as a foundation for further exploration and enhancements in robotics.
## Usage
## 1. Launch the Robot in Gazebo
### To start the robot simulation in Gazebo, use the following launch command:
```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
```

## 2. Launch the Robot Description in RViz
### To visualize the robot model in RViz, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.py
```

## 3. Control the Movement of the 4-Wheeled Robot
### To control the robot's movement using keyboard teleoperation, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel
```
## 4. Test the Arm Movement
### To test the arm's movement, publish a joint trajectory using the following command:

```bash
ros2 topic pub -1 /set_joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory '{header: {frame_id: "base_footprint"}, joint_names: ["arm_base_forearm_joint", "forearm_hand_joint"], points: [{positions: [0.1, 0.4]}]}'
```
# Enhancement 1

After the initial design of the two-wheeled robot, the project was enhanced to include a four-wheeled robot for improved stability and control. Additionally, a two-jointed arm was integrated to provide more advanced manipulation capabilities. This enhancement allows the robot to perform more complex tasks and navigate more effectively. The upgraded design offers a more versatile platform for various robotic applications.

## Usage
## 1. Launch the Robot in Gazebo
### To start the robot simulation in Gazebo, use the following launch command:
```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
```

## 2. Launch the Robot Description in RViz
### To visualize the robot model in RViz, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.py
```

## 3. Control the Movement of the 4-Wheeled Robot
### To control the robot's movement using keyboard teleoperation, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel
```
## 4. Test the Arm Movement
### To test the arm's movement, publish a joint trajectory using the following command:

```bash
ros2 topic pub -1 /set_joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory '{header: {frame_id: "base_footprint"}, joint_names: ["arm_base_forearm_joint", "forearm_hand_joint"], points: [{positions: [0.1, 0.4]}]}'
```

# Enhancement 2

The project was further enhanced by upgrading to a four-wheeled robot with a 6-DOF arm, providing greater mobility and flexibility. A 5-finger mechanical gripper was added to the arm, enabling more precise object handling and manipulation. This enhancement allows the robot to perform more complex tasks with a higher degree of dexterity. The 6-DOF arm with the 5-finger gripper enhances the robot‚Äôs ability to interact with its environment in a more sophisticated manner.

##  Launch the Robot Description in RViz
### To visualize the robot model in RViz, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.py
```

# Enhancement 3

Building on the previous enhancement, the two-jointed arm was further upgraded to a 6-DOF arm, offering greater flexibility and precision. A mechanical gripper was also added to enable more complex manipulation tasks, such as picking and placing objects. This upgrade significantly expands the robot's capabilities in performing various operations. The 6-DOF arm with a gripper provides enhanced dexterity for handling a wide range of objects.

##  Launch the Robot Description in RViz
### To visualize the robot model in RViz, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.py
```

### How to setup this project in local environment
1. **Create a workspace**: The first step is to create a ROS 2 workspace (`~/ros2_ws/src`) and navigate to it.
2. **Clone the project**: Clone the repository from GitHub into the `src` folder.
3. **Build the workspace**: Use `colcon build` to build all the packages in the workspace.
4. **Source the setup file**: This step ensures that ROS 2 knows about the packages you just built.
5. **Launch commands**: Instructions to launch the robot simulation in Gazebo and visualize it in RViz.

# Robot Control and Simulation

## Setup

## 1. Create a ROS 2 Workspace

### First, create a new ROS 2 workspace by following these steps:
