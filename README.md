## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools Used

This project uses the following technologies and tools for simulating and visualizing the mobile robot with a 6-DOF arm:

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)** ‚Äì Middleware for robot software development
- **Gazebo** ‚Äì 3D robotics simulator for testing robot behavior in virtual environments
- **RViz** ‚Äì Visualization tool for robot state, TFs, and sensor data
- **URDF / Xacro** ‚Äì For defining the robot's physical structure and joint configurations
- **Python** ‚Äì Used in ROS 2 launch files and scripts (e.g., `arm_gazebo.launch.py`)
- **XML** ‚Äì Used in older-style launch files and robot descriptions (e.g., `display.launch.xml`)
- **YAML** ‚Äì Configuration files (e.g., `arm_controllers.yaml`) for controllers and plugins
- **CMake / package.xml** ‚Äì Standard ROS 2 package configuration and build system

### üóÇÔ∏è Key Packages

- `my_robot_description/` ‚Äì Contains URDF/Xacro files, robot structure, sensors, and configurations
- `my_robot_bringup/` ‚Äì Launch files for starting the simulation, RViz, and Gazebo
- `worlds/` ‚Äì Custom simulation world (e.g., `test_world.world`)
- `rviz/` ‚Äì RViz visualization configuration

# Two-Wheeled Robot with Jointed Arm

## Project Overview

We started this project with a two-wheeled robot design, incorporating one caster wheel for stability. The robot is equipped with a two-jointed arm to enable basic manipulation tasks. Our goal is to create a functional robot capable of autonomous movement and object interaction. The project serves as a foundation for further exploration and enhancements in robotics.
